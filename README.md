# Verilog HDL Series – Day 2: Half Adder & Full Adder

This repository is part of my daily Verilog HDL learning series shared on LinkedIn.

## 🧠 Modules Implemented
- **Half Adder**: Binary addition of two single-bit inputs
- **Full Adder**: Binary addition of two bits + carry-in

## 📂 Files Included
/adders/
│
├── half_adder.v
├── full_adder.v
├── tb_half_adder.v
├── tb_full_adder.v
├── waveforms

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Vivado (Version 2021.1)
- Verilog HDL
- Custom Testbenches

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Understand basic binary arithmetic at gate level
- Learn how to create modular, reusable Verilog code
- Simulate and verify functionality using waveform outputs

## 📸 Simulation
Waveform results and RTL schematic screenshots are available in the `/waveforms` folder.
